# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive DSA Mentor is an enhanced version of the existing DSA workflow that transforms the current automated problem-solving approach into an interactive, human-in-the-loop learning experience. Instead of providing complete solutions upfront, the mentor will guide users through problems step-by-step with hints, questions, and progressive assistance, allowing learners to develop problem-solving skills at their own pace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student learning data structures and algorithms, I want to receive progressive hints and guidance when solving problems, so that I can develop my problem-solving skills rather than just seeing complete solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a DSA problem THEN the system SHALL provide an initial problem analysis and ask what aspect they'd like help with
2. WHEN a user requests a hint THEN the system SHALL provide a contextual hint base
