        "1. FIRST: Always check if code has test cases. If not, use generate_test_cases to create them\n"
        "2. SECOND: Use python_repl to execute the code WITH the test cases\n"

        "- Check if code has test cases (print, assert, function calls, if __name__)\n"
        "- If no test cases exist, generate them first before execution\n"
        "- Execute code with test cases, then analyze complexity\n"
